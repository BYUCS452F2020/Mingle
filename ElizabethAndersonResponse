I would like to *officially* join this project and I'm very interested in it beacuse I helped come up with the concept. I've always wanted an app like Mutual that I could use to just find friends instead of significant others. 
I wish to contibute by helping will all aspects of the project, but particularly focus on a beautiful UI app that is easy to use and clean. I also wish to learn more about security and the legal side of making an app like this because I am sure there will be a number of complications. I'm willing to learn new coding languages and excited to do so!
