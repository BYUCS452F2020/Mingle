I'm interested in joining this project. It looks like it has both an interesting front-end and back-end that would be fun
to develop as well as providing a cool service. It looks well thought out in terms of the business, legal and technical 
aspects.

I have experience with different languages, including some flutter experience. I also have about 3 years of proffessional
experience working with back-ends and databases including MySQL and some MongoDB as well as developing mobile apps that
interact with back-ends. I still have a lot to learn and love learning from people I work with.

If you let me be on your team, I'm very interested in getting started, meeting deadlines and putting in work up front so
that there is less to do as the semester goes on. I'm happy to work on any part of the project, and am willing to learn
whatever I need to to help the project succeed

If yyou decide to accept me, let me know (maybe by Slack?). If not, no worries, but it would be great to let me know either 
way so I can keep looking. Thanks!

Tristan Henderson
