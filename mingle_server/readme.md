# Mingle Server

## Description

The Mingle server handles the back-end work of the Mingle mobile application.

## Setup

### Local

To set up the Mingle server locally, use the following steps:

1. Install Node and NPM on the system.
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the server's external dependencies.
3. Create a config.json file with appropriate settings for your environment.
4. To run the server, execute `npm run start`. For testing, run `npm run test`*.

\* Running the server with the test script will run the server with the `Nodemon`
package which allows for hot reloading of the server without having to stop and start
it again.

### Remote

If we get a droplet or other server, the deployment instructions can go here.
