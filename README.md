# Mingle

Find friends and events near you!

## Project description
Have you ever moved somewhere new and wanted to meet friends? Or maybe you’re looking for something fun to do on Saturday night and all your roommates are out of town. Introducing Mingle! An app we want to develop that will let you see profiles of people nearby who are also looking for someone to hang-out with. You can specify when you’re free, what you like to do, and basic information about yourself. Think of this as Mutual or Tinder but instead of looking for that significant other, you’re just looking for a friend or a party. 

## Team
We have a team of 2 already: Elizabeth Anderson and Ryan Leach. We’re potentially looking for another person to join.

## SQL
MySQL (or PostgreSQL) 

## NoSQL
Document Database powered by MongoDB

## Business
This could be really cool to grow as a business, but for the purposes of the class we are just looking to populate it with fake data to work with.

## Legal
There will definitely be some legal considerations here:
Ensuring privacy of the individuals and the data they can share
Having a release (terms of use) that waives liability in case there are fraudulent users and to ensure eligibility (over 18) 
Profile reporting system

## Technical
Our priorities will be:
Create Schema / database
User table 
Chat table
Saved Events
Matching table (users)
Event table
Create fake data 
UI development (do it in Flutter)
